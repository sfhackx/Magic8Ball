## Magic 8-Ball

Will my celebrity crush ever fall in love with me? Do aliens exist? Sometimes life’s simplest questions do not have simple yes or no answers. At least that was the case ... until Einstein came along! That’s right – Your Salesforce org has the definitive answers to all of life’s mysteries, just like that Magic 8-Ball in elementary school.

### Requirements

- Questions for Einstein are related to contacts, include contact data in their predictions, and store an answer to each question in a picklist field
- In order to coach Einstein a little bit, sample contacts and answered questions are used
- Salesforce users can submit questions on behalf of contacts (**Bonus**: Provide contacts with options to submit their own questions)
- If Einstein is confident enough in its answer, send the prediction to the contact
- If Einstein is not so sure, send the question through an approval process for the 8-Ball Magicians to review & answer
